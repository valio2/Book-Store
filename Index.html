                <p class="description">JavaScript is the programming language of the Internet, the secret sauce that makes the Web awesome, your
                    favorite sites interactive, and online games fun! JavaScript for Kids is a lighthearted introduction
                    that teaches programming essentials through patient, step-by-step examples paired with funny illustrations.
                    You’ll begin with the basics, like working with strings, arrays, and loops, and then move on to more
                    advanced topics, like building interactivity with jQuery and drawing graphics with Canvas. Along the
                    way, you’ll write games such as Find the Buried Treasure, Hangman, and Snake. You’ll also learn how to:
                    –Create functions to organize and reuse your code –Write and modify HTML to create dynamic web pages
                    –Use the DOM and jQuery to make your web pages react to user input –Use the Canvas element to draw and
                    animate graphics –Program real user-controlled games with collision detection and score keeping With
                    visual examples like bouncing balls, animated bees, and racing cars, you can really see what you’re programming.
                    Each chapter builds on the last, and programming challenges at the end of each chapter will stretch your
                    brain and inspire your own amazing programs. Make something cool with JavaScript today!</p>
